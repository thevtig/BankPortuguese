# Performance of Classifiers Model Using Portuguese banking institution

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model shows high precision in identifying clients who are not likely to subscribe to the term deposit (class 0), with a precision of 92%. This indicates a strong ability to minimize false positives in this category. However, for potential subscribers (class 1), while the model has moderate precision, its recall is low. This suggests that although the model is somewhat accurate when it predicts a subscription, it misses a significant number of clients who might be interested in the product.

The Logistic Regression model exhibits a similar performance to KNN for class 0, again effectively predicting non-subscribers. However, it also struggles with a low recall rate for class 1, indicating a substantial number of potential subscribers are not being identified.

The Decision Tree model provides a more balanced approach, with a relatively even performance between precision and recall for both classes. However, it has a lower precision for potential subscribers and a slightly lower overall accuracy. This model might be more suitable in scenarios where a balanced identification of both subscribers and non-subscribers is crucial.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model stands out with the highest precision for potential subscribers (69%). Nevertheless, like the other models, its recall for this class is low, suggesting that while it is reliable when identifying a likely subscriber, many are still overlooked.

Based on these insights, several recommendations can be made. First, there is a clear need to improve the identification of potential subscribers. This could involve refining the features used in the models, collecting more nuanced data, or exploring advanced modeling techniques. In terms of model selection, the choice should align with the bank’s marketing objectives. For instance, if minimizing false positives in predicting potential subscribers is critical, the SVM model would be preferable. Alternatively, if a balanced identification of both subscribers and non-subscribers is desired, the Decision Tree model might be more appropriate.

Additionally, further analysis into the features that most strongly influence subscription likelihood could provide actionable insights for tailoring the bank's marketing approaches. Regularly updating the models with new campaign data would help capture evolving client behavior and market trends. Enhancing customer engagement strategies during calls, such as through personalized offers, could also potentially increase subscription rates. Lastly, the insights from the models could be used to identify cross-selling opportunities, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the marketing campaigns.

In summary, while the models provide a solid foundation for understanding client behavior in relation to the bank’s term deposit product, there is room for improvement, particularly in better identifying potential subscribers. Aligning model selection and refinement with the bank’s strategic marketing goals will be key to maximizing the effectiveness of future campaigns.
